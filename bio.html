	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<h3>I'm <a href="index.html">Gabe Joseph</a>, a sophomore from San Francisco majoring in computer science at <a href="http://www.tufts.edu">Tufts</a>.</h3>
	<p>I'm interested in how computers can help us make sense of, represent, and act on information. (This has included <a href="#">analyzing the productivity of a room</a> and <a href="#">tracking rumor spread on Facebook</a>.) I've worked at the <a href="http://www.ceeo.tufts.edu">Tufts Center for Engineering Education and Outreach</a>, creating a protocol for devices (like Arduinos) to <a href="#">communicate with optical touchscreens</a> using IR light, and am currently working on a system to simplify the capture and analysis of multi-camera data from research on classrooms.</p>
	<p>Beyond the screen, I'm usually found leading ice climbing, rock climbing, hiking, and whitewater kayaking trips, and teaching outdoor skills courses with the <a href="http://www.tuftsmountainclub.org">Tufts Mountain Club</a>.</p>
